# iomt-attack-detection-v2 (IoMT Multi-Classifier Project Summary)

## Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning system for detecting and classifying attacks on Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks. It processes network traffic data to identify various attack types including DDoS, DoS, ARP spoofing, reconnaissance, and malformed MQTT packets, providing a foundation for real-time security monitoring. The project is based upon CICIoMT2024 dataset and study.
## Key Components and Their Interactions
### 1. Data Processing Layer
- **DataLoader**: Handles efficient loading and preprocessing of network traffic CSV files
- **Feature Processor**: Performs feature extraction, normalization, and encoding
- **Feature Selection**: Identifies and selects the most relevant features for attack detection
### 2. Model Training Layer
- **Data Balancer**: Addresses extreme class imbalance (971:1 ratio) in the dataset
- **Model Trainers**: Implements multiple classifier algorithms (LightGBM, SGD, HistGradientBoosting)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Uses RandomizedSearchCV for efficient parameter optimization
- **Model Evaluation**: Compares model performance using precision, recall, F1-score metrics
### 3. Deployment Layer
- **Model Registry**: Stores and versions trained models with their performance metrics
- **FastAPI Service**: Provides RESTful endpoints for real-time prediction
- **ONNX Exporter**: Converts models to ONNX format for optimized inference
### 4. Web Framework (Planned)
- **REST API**: Interface for sending network traffic data for analysis
- **Real-time Detection**: Low-latency prediction (5-10ms per sample)
- **Alert System**: Notification mechanism for detected attacks
- **Dashboard**: Visualization of network security status and attack patterns
